# AdventOfCode2022
A repository to hold my solutions to the advent of code puzzles for the year 2022. I think I will create solutions in C++ or C# for most puzzles when the difficulty starts to rise, and maybe do some of the easier days again in some other languages to get a little more comfortable with the syntax. That or I may embrace the python life style.

# Challenges For This Year
- [ ] Complete all 25 challenge days. Due by the 1st of January.
- [ ] Use assembly to solve at least one problem part. Can be done in another language first.
- [ ] Use a brand new language or one I've had minimal interaction with (< 2 hours experience).
- [x] Complete one part in a single line of code (a list of linq queries is acceptable, I just can't make anything new really).
- [ ] Try to visualise one problem in VR or a data graph.

# Day One (C++)
Today I have visitors from Scotland, so my plan of using assembly on the first day is a bit shot for now. As I'd need more time to really get to grips with the very basics I'd need for this challenge. 
I may come back to do the first part at least in assembly later, as it's one of my goals to achieve for this year.

For now, this showed me it's been a while since I've wrote C++ as the file loading seemed an immediate pain, which made me re-use the InputGrabber class I made for AOC two years ago.

# Day Two (C#)
So far I've only done the first part of the problem, purely because I wanted to make it in a single line.. And boi was that a horrible line. More magical than the Harry Potter series.
